            <h1>ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT A FASHION DESIGNER</h1>
            <p>
                Fashion design is the art of applying design, aesthetics,
                clothing construction and natural beauty to clothing and its
                accessories. It is influenced by culture and different trends,
                and has varied over time and place. "A fashion designer creates
                clothing, including dresses, suits, pants, and skirts, and
                accessories like shoes and handbags, for consumers. He or she
                can specialize in clothing, accessory, or jewelry design, or may
                work in more than one of these areas.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fashion designers work in a variety of different ways when
                designing their pieces and accessories such as rings, bracelets,
                necklaces and earrings. Due to the time required to put a
                garment out in market, designers must anticipate changes to
                consumer desires. Fashion designers are responsible for creating
                looks for individual garments, involving shape, color, fabric,
                trimming, and more. Some clothes are made specifically for an
                individual, as in the case of haute couture or bespoke
                tailoring. Today, most clothing is designed for the mass market,
                especially casual and every-day wear are called ready to wear or
                known as fast fashion.
